#Starter code for color dictionary
# December 21, 2012 - Mayan Calendar ended and the world should have to
#Hey we are still arround :)
# Color Dictionary
# You would look up color values by the color and not by an inedx
#It is easier to catagorize the R G B values by color than index in a list
# you could use a nested list but this is where a dictionary is very useful
# Variable List:
#   colors - the dictionary of colors and there values

print ("Welcome to The Dark Knight Program \n\n")

# creates the dictionary: key color -- value R G B values
colors = {"Red": (255,0,0),
           "Green": (0,255,0),
           "Blue": (0,0,255)
          "Orange": (255,128,0)
          "Purple": (153,51,255)}
           

#Ask the user for a color
Acolor = input("What Color are you looking for?")



# Display the R G B values if it is in the list



# If the Color is NOT in the list ask for the R G B values
# add it to the dictionary of Colors


    
# Ask the user if they need to look up more colors

#Display the entire dictionary in 2 columns
#Color Key      R G B values
