#Dictionaries Guided Notes

# Dictionaries: an object that stores a collection of data.
#     Each element in a dictionary has ________ parts:
#     a _____________ and a ______________.
#     Often referred to as mappings


# 1) Creating a dictionary
#     you create a dictionary using curly braces { }
#     you seperate a key from it's value using a colon :
#     you seperate elements using a comma




 #Notice that elements are not stored
                        #in a particular order. They display differently.
                        #So we can not use indexing/slicing.

# 2) Retrieving a value


# 3) in & not in


# 4) Adding elements to an existing Dictionary

# if the key exists then it doesn't add it, it updates it

# Keys must be unique, No duplicates
# won't give you a syntax error, just ignores duplicate

# 5) Deleting elements from an existing dictionary


# 6) Getting the number of elements in a dictionary


# 7) adding to a dicitonary with user input
# YOU TRY!


# 8)- get() Gets the value associated with a specified key.
#               Returns a default value if not found


# 9) Other dictionary methods

# A- sort()
# the sort method does not work with dictionaries.
# You do not need to know how to sort dictionaries.

# B- clear() Clears the contents of a dictionary
